I am Mohayemin, a software engineer and researcher.  

I finished my PhD in Software Engineering under the supervision of [Dr. Sarah Nadi](https://sanadlab.org/profiles/sarah/) at the University of Alberta in 2025. 
In my PhD, I focused on *library migration*, the process of replacing one library with another in a software application. 
I built PyMigTool, a tool that automates library migration in Python applications using program synthesis and large language models.
