This is Mohayemin, as Software Engineer. Currently I am doing PhD [Software Maintenance and Reuse (SMR) Lab](https://sarahnadi.org/smr/), [Department of Computing Science](https://www.cs.ualberta.ca/), [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/). I am trying to help developers overcome the challenges of switching from one library to another.

Previously I taught Software Engineering at the [Islamic University of Technology (IUT)](https://www.iutoic-dhaka.edu/).
Before that, I worked at [Streams Tech Ltd](https://www.streamstech.com.bd/) as a Software Engineer for more than 5 years.
I did my MS and BS in Software Engineering at [Institute of Information Technology](http://www.iit.du.ac.bd/), [University of Dhaka](https://www.du.ac.bd/).

I was born and raised in Bangladesh and lived most of my life in Dhaka city.  

## Research
Software applications typically depend on libraries that evolve independently of the application. Due to many reasons; e.g., library going out of maintenance,  library not supporting desired features; the libraries may become incompatible with the application. In this situation, application developers must replace the existing library with a competitive one. Manually replacing libraries can be time-consuming and error-prone, but can potentially be automated. My research goal is to develop tools and techniques for efficient and reliable library migration.

## Teaching
I taught the following courses at [IUT](https://www.iutoic-dhaka.edu/). 
* SWE 4601 - Software Design and Architecture (Winter 2020)
* SWE 4501 - Design Patterns (Summer 2019)
* SWE 4401 - Software Requirements Specification (Summer 2019)
* SWE 4301 - Object Oriented Concepts II (Summer 2019)
